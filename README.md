# Work in Progress!
As of writing, this script is capable of automatic installing and backing up of applications, but implementation of archive autosetup is still ongoing.
# Linux Autosetup
Linux Autosetup is a script that uses bash to automate installation and backup processes. Its goal is to be as configurable as possible to fit the needs of the user. For a while now, I've been bothered by the lack of an easily portable program that can quickly set up or back up my systems how I want them, so I decided to start my own personal project. Maybe someone else will find this useful, though.
# Usage
/** to do **/
# Compability
This script is currently being tested on Mint and Fedora, but it should work on most, if not all modern distros. It takes advantage of some features that require newer versions of Bash (e.g. double-bracket if statements), so it won't work on POSIX shells.
