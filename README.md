# Linux-autosetup
Linux-autosetup is a Bash script that attempts to alleviate and ease installation and backup processes through the use of config files, reducing downtime from pains like forgetting to install apps and backups on fresh installs or backing up files by following crude text documents. It aims to be as configurable as possible so that users can customize how and what they want to back up or install.

# Requirements
- Bash 5.0.17+ (Older versions may also work, but this is not guaranteed)
- A Linux distribution

# Documentation
You can find documentation on how to download and use this script on the [wiki](https://github.com/aurtzy/linux-autosetup/wiki).
