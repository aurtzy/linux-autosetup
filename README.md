# Linux AutoSetup
Linux Autosetup is a script that uses bash to automate installation and backup processes. Its goal is to be as configurable as possible so that additions and removals can be made with minimal effort.

This program was born from an inability to find a program where I could quickly set up an installation depending on the system or easily set up backups for applications. I might want to set up my main pc for gaming and schoolwork, for example, but my laptop wouldn't need that gaming software - this is supposed to make that application installation process quicker and easier. When I'd back up my system, I'd have to go through different directories to grab files according to a crude text document kept somewhere. If you have the same problems, maybe you'll find this script useful.
# Requirements
This script has only been tested on Mint and Fedora so far, but any Linux distribution with a newer version of Bash should work just fine, as it is possible to configure installation commands to whatever suits your distro.

Linux Autosetup will require some initial configuration beforehand. As such, some basic knowledge of Bash may be helpful in understanding the syntax behind the config settings - however, I have tried (and will keep trying) to document the workings of the script as thouroughly as possible, both in this readme and an example config so that configuration is as easy as possible.
