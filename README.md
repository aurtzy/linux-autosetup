# Work in Progress!
As of writing, this script is capable of automatic installing and backing up of applications, but implementation of automatic setting up of archives is still ongoing.
# Linux Autosetup
Linux Autosetup is a script that uses bash to automate installation and backup processes. Its goal is to be as configurable as possible to fit the needs of the user. For a while now, I've been bothered by the lack of an easily portable program that can quickly set up or back up my systems how I want them, so I decided to start my own personal project. Maybe someone else will find this useful, though.
# Requirements
This script has been tested on Mint and Fedora, but any Linux distribution with a newer version of Bash should work just fine, as it is possible to configure installation commands to whatever is suitable for your distro.
Configuration is a large part of Linux Autosetup, which means that it may require some initial setup beforehand to cater to your needs. As such, some basic knowledge of Bash may be helpful in understanding the syntax behind configurating settings - otherwise, I have tried (and will keep trying) to document the workings of the script as much as possible, both in this readme and in comments of the files.
