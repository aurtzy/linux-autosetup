# Work in Progress...
As of writing, this script is capable of automatic installing and backing up of applications, but implementation of automatic setting up of archives is still ongoing.
# Linux Autosetup
Linux Autosetup is a script that uses bash to automate installation and backup processes. Its goal is to be as configurable as possible so that additions and removals can be made with minimal effort. The lack of an easily portable program that I can use to quickly set up or back up a system depending on what I use it for has bothered me for quite a long time time. I might want to set up my main pc for gaming and schoolwork for example, but my laptop won't need that gaming software. Hence, I decided to start this as my own personal project. Maybe someone else will find this useful.
# Requirements
This script has been tested only on Mint and Fedora so far, but any Linux distribution with a newer version of Bash should work just fine, as it is possible to configure installation commands to whatever suits your distro.

Linux Autosetup may require some initial configuration beforehand in order to build it how you want. As such, some basic knowledge of Bash may be helpful in understanding the syntax behind the config settings - however, I have tried (and will keep trying) to document the workings of the script as thouroughly as possible, both in this readme and in comments of the files.
