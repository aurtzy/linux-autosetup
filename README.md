# Overview
scriptman is a DIY-oriented Python script that aims to provide systems for building highly modular scripts,
letting users run only the scripts they want whenever they need them. It does this without requiring scripts 
to conform to specific executable types, making scriptman largely portable across different systems.

## Features

- ruamel.yaml : 0.17
- PyOxidizer : 0.22

## Manually building scriptman
scriptman uses PyOxidizer to build its standalone executables.

To build an executable, navigate to the directory where `pyoxidizer.bzl` is located and run:

```pyoxidizer build exe```
