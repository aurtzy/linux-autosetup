# Linux Autosetup
Linux Autosetup is a script that uses bash to automate installation and backup processes. Its goal is to be as configurable as possible to fit the needs of the user.
# Usage
/** to do **/
# Compability
This script is currently being tested on Mint and Fedora, but it should work on most if not all modern distros. It takes advantage of some features that require newer versions of Bash (e.g. double-bracket if statements), so it won't work on POSIX shells.
